## EXAMPLE SCRIPT!!!
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Mosquitoes sampled from CO2 traps
#mosquito <- "DP1.10043.001"

# Precipitation - weighing gauge
#precipitation <- "DP1.00044.001"

# Select two focal sites for now
#my_sites <- c("BART", "WOOD")

# Start date (as YYYY-MM)
#start_date <- "2020-01"

# End date (as YYYY-MM)
#end_date <- "2022-12"

#list2env((loadByProduct(dpID = mosquito, 
 #                       site = my_sites, 
  #                      include.provisional = FALSE,
   #                     startdate = start_date,
    #                    enddate = end_date)),
     #    .GlobalEnv)

# Variable names and units: mosquitoes
#variables_10043 %>% 
#  write_csv(here("data", "raw", "variables_10043.csv"))

#rm(list = ls())
```

```{r}
#This is an example to show pushing
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
